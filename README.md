# PixelGram
CS Team Project - Socially driven wallpaper sharing.

## Getting Started

The following need to be installed to get started with developing for PixelGram from a clean install on Windows... Don't give me that look. It's necessary.

    - Install Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        - Create a folder for the project, navigate to this folder using cd.
        - (cmd) git clone https://github.com/JamesBream/PixelGram.git

The best way to learn how to use Git is probably by using this, despite it being tedious as f*ck. https://try.github.io/

    - Install Python 3.5.x
    - (cmd) pip install flask
    - (cmd) pip install flask-mysqldb
    
No troubles? Awesome.

    - Install MariaDB 10.1.x
    - Set root password (For security)
    
Finally, some utilities... (Yeah, we're getting there, almost I think.)

    - Install Adobe Brackets
    - Install MySQL Workbench

I honestly, think that's it. If you've cloned the repository from Github, you should be able to do `python app.py` in cmd in order to run the server. This will need restarting if you change the Python code but should be ok to leave running if you're working with anything else.
